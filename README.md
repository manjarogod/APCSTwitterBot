* I found this link to do some Machine Learning, tried learning it on my own but I didn't want to create my own dataset: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-own-sentiment-analyzer-using-python-and-googles-natural-language-api-9e91e1c493e/

## To Do
* Collect data, see which Tweets get the most likes and engagement, while following the ArbyBot Criteria
* Implement Machine Learning somehow
